"""IPC protocol shared between box-server and the in-sandbox daemon.

The protocol is intentionally tiny: every message is a single 4-byte
big-endian length prefix followed by exactly that many bytes of payload.
JSON objects describe the request/response semantics, while raw bytes
(stdin contents, captured stdout/stderr) ride alongside as additional
length-prefixed frames so we can carry binary payloads safely.

Stays standard-library only so the daemon (loaded with ``python3 -S``
inside the sandbox) does not have to drag in the rest of jiuwenbox to
participate in IPC.

# Names match between server and daemon; do not rename without bumping the

# live under ``/jiuwenbox`` (a fresh tmpfs created per sandbox by the
# runtime). The directory is reserved by ``PolicyEngine`` - user policies
# cannot reference any path under it - so collisions with
# ``read_only`` / ``read_write`` / ``bind_mounts`` / ``device`` entries
# are rejected at policy-validation time, and ``/jiuwenbox`` is also kept
# *outside* the Landlock allowlist so user code spawned by the daemon
# cannot read either script after Landlock applies.

# Box-server binds the listener Unix socket on the host filesystem and
# passes the listener fd into the sandbox via
# ``subprocess.Popen(pass_fds=...)``. Bubblewrap's user command path never
# closes arbitrary inherited fds, so the listener flows untouched through
# bwrap → launcher → daemon. The daemon recovers the fd number from this
# environment variable and runs ``accept`` against it directly. This
# keeps the IPC channel entirely outside the sandbox view: there is no
# path inside the sandbox that points at the control socket, so user
# code spawned by the daemon cannot reach it (and the daemon spawns user
# children with ``close_fds=True`` so the inherited fd is not exposed
# either).
