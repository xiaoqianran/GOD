> Most generative-agent projects ship great research and great replays.
> **GOD is the missing operator console** — a single screen where you can pause, ask, intervene, and reset a society of LLM agents while it is alive.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎮 &nbsp;**Live pixel-town control room** — replay any step, pause, fast-forward, or auto-run.
- 💬 &nbsp;**Ask any agent anything** — targeted questions to one resident or to the whole town, mid-simulation.
- 🎛️ &nbsp;**Direct interventions** — inject new instructions into upcoming steps and watch the agents react.
- 🔄 &nbsp;**One-command reset** — wipe stale replay data and start a clean experiment.
- 🧱 &nbsp;**Local, hackable, single-config** — one `.env`, one script, no Docker required.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/GOD.git
cd GOD
./scripts/god.sh start
```

On the first run, GOD asks for three model settings:

| Variable | Example |
| --- | --- |
| `GOD_LLM_API_KEY` | `sk-...` |
| `GOD_LLM_API_BASE` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `GOD_LLM_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4` |

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works. When the stack is ready, open:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5174/pixel-replay/god_town/1
```

## 🧩 Features

|     | Feature | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🎬 | **Replay control** | Scrub a live or recorded experiment by step, pause, auto-run. |
| 💬 | **Targeted ask** | Direct natural-language questions to one agent or to everyone. |
| 🎛️ | **Step interventions** | Inject instructions for the next step; the simulation reacts immediately. |
| 🧼 | **Fresh runs** | One command to wipe a stale run and re-seed a clean simulation. |
| 🗺️ | **Pixel town world** | Locations, actions, messages, and agent status, all replay-friendly. |
| 🛠️ | **Single config** | One `.env`, one script, sane defaults. |

## 🏗️ How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Op["Operator"] --> UI["Control Room<br/>React + Vite"]
  UI <--> Backend["GOD Backend<br/>FastAPI · live + replay"]
  Backend --> Town["Pixel Town<br/>init config + step plan"]
  Backend --> Store[("Replay Store")]
  Backend <--> Runtime["Agent Runtime<br/>LLM-backed agents"]
```

| Layer | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Control Room** | React/Vite UI for replay, ask, intervention, and status. |
| **Backend** | Local FastAPI service exposing live and replay APIs. |
| **Pixel Town** | Replay-friendly social world: locations, actions, messages, agent status. |
| **Agent Runtime** | Out-of-process LLM agents reached over a local WebSocket. |

## ⚙️ Commands

```bash
./scripts/god.sh start      # start the full stack (idempotent)
./scripts/god.sh new-run    # wipe replay data and start a fresh session
./scripts/god.sh status     # ports, URLs, model status
./scripts/god.sh stop       # stop everything
./scripts/god.sh tail       # follow logs
./scripts/god.sh open       # open the control room in the default browser
```

## 🧪 Default Experiment

```text
god_town
├── 10 residents with distinct personas
├── A pixel town: houses, paths, and a town square
└── A scripted step plan you can intervene at any point
```

To run your own experiment, drop a new config under `quick_experiments/` and point `GOD_EXPERIMENT` at it.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-town experiments in one control room
- [ ] Persistent operator notes per step
- [ ] Pluggable map manifests
- [ ] Hosted public demo

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. To set up a dev environment:

```bash
./scripts/god.sh start
```

That installs Python and Node dependencies, brings up the full stack, and opens a live session. From there, edit and reload.
